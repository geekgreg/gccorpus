# gccorpus
Python script for converting conference talks to json format, divided by paragraph. 

Written by me and chatgpt, but mostly chatgpt. :) 

goes through the churchofjesuschrist.org website for any range of years. grabs the links for talks, and uses beautifulsoup to find the title, speaker, calling, and talk.  It then divides the talk into paragraph blocks and exports as a json file into a folder for each session.
